                                Python turle - We were introduced to the world of digital patterns and colors using turtle.We asked to unleash our creative side of us by creating random patterns and we were challenged to do an animation.We went from zero graphic knowledge to a very comfortable zone where we were able to create any pattern using different colours.

                            UI & UX - The most fun filled session which had mimicked our kinder-garden days at many instances was handled by Mr. Navaneeth from Alchi designs, Bangalore.He was an UI/UX expert, who began his session by making us scribble.The session demanded a lot of our artistic skills as he was trying to pull out the last shreds of creativity that still existed in some corners of our brains.He walked us through what UI/UX was and how it is done.He told us few trips and tricks to make our designs stand out.In the evening, all of collaborated to come up with a problem statement and each of the teams were asked to come up with their own unique solutions and present our ideas to the crowd.
